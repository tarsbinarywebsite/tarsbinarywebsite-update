                    This program offers short courses in the form of workshops
                    that are designed for children who have completed their
                    Junior and Apprentice programs. The workshops aim to polish
                    the knowledge and skills that the children have acquired and
                    help them specialize in one or more subjects of their
                    choice. Those who participate in the workshops will receive
                    a certificate that they can use to open profiles on TES
                    Workstation and start their outsourcing careers. The top
                    three highest scorers will also have the opportunity to join
                    TARS Engineering School as trainers/teachers
